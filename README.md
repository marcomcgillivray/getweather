The Komodo Internship listing was brought to my attention on Thursday 1st December, as I don't currently have anything on my portfolio so I decided to build a basic ReactJS weather app over the last 2 days using the Fetch API calling the VisualCrossing weather API.

Unfortunately I found too late the weather data from this free API was not always accurate, however I think this app is a good representation of my ReactJS ability at present, and comfort level using the Fetch API and React Hooks
